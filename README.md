# CS250-Agile

Understanding and implementing user needs requires a systematic approach. First, it is necessary to gather requirements through interviews, observations, and/or discussions with actual users. It’s important to focus on what they are trying to accomplish rather than specific features. User stories help bridge the gap between these needs and implementation and should follow “As a [description of user], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].”(ProductPlan, 2024) format. This format forces you to think from the user’s perspective and allows you to focus on the outcome, not the feature. 

I think the biggest takeaway from learning Agile for me has been the benefits of an iterative process. Not trying to build everything at once but trying to focus on getting the core functionality up and running and tested. Then you can incrementally add features while incorporating user feedback and changing priorities. 

I think there are a lot of different behaviors that go into being a good team member. One of the most important ones is good communication. This is built into Agile development. Daily scrums help keep everyone up to date with what each other is doing so you can lend a hand if someone needs help. Good documentation in your code is another way you can be a good communicator. Asking questions instead of assuming also helps make sure that everyone is on the same page.
